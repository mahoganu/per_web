                    <h1>My name is Robert Kenworthy</h1>
                    <br>
                    <p>I'm a student at Rice University in Houston, Texas, studying Electrical Engineering with a concentration in Data Science, expecting to graduate in '23.</p>
                    <p>My interest do not soley lie within the broad field of Electrical Engineering. I have a passion for design, machine learning, and the collection, processing, and visualization of data.
                        I seek to experience and develop these altogether with a focus on how machine learning and data collection can be optimized and utilized for the design and 
                        development of autonomous devices or algorithms. I realized during my first two years at school, most of the physical aspect of design has been greatly modulated
                        and only a more intense field such as research would consistently require me to use the more tradition EE skills I have learned. Because of this, 
                        I have found a greater attraction to the software side of design, since software allows much more flexibility and less lag time to see the final product than 
                        compared to hardware design. I am still branching out and discovering new niches everyday, and pushing myself to experience as much as I can within the Venn Diagram containing
                        electrical engineering and computer science topics. </p>
